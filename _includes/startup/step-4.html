<h1>4. Debug your grid</h1>

Everything is easy until something goes wrong. The UnitGS helps you to find out where the problem might be.

{% highlight sass %}
//Activate the grid debug system by setting the global variable $grid-debug.
$grid-debug: true;
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>4.1 Colorize your grid units</h2>

<div id="debug-layout">
  <div class="sketch-header">header</div>
  <div class="sketch-nav">nav</div>
  <div class="sketch-section-A">A</div>
  <div class="sketch-section-B">B</div>
  <div class="sketch-footer">footer</div>
</div>

<p>When the debug mode is activated, all the grid units will have a different color so that you can easily distinguish them.</p>

<h2>4.2 See the media queries in action</h2>

<div id="debug-responsive-layout">
  <div class="sketch-header">header</div>
  <div class="sketch-nav">nav</div>
  <div class="sketch-section-A">A</div>
  <div class="sketch-section-B">B</div>
  <div class="sketch-footer">footer</div>
</div>

<p>As you can see, only the two grid units that were updated change colors.</p>

<p>This is perfect to debug your responsive design. Resize your browser and you will see that only the
grid units that where updated will change color, allowing you to clearly see where you are making changes.</p>

<p class="curiosity">Curiosity: The colors of the logo came from the colors generated by the debug mode.</p>

<h2>4.3 Define the areas to debug</h2>

<p>If you want, you can activate the debug system in selected areas only.</p>

{% highlight sass %}
...
$grid-debug: true; // Activate on enter
... // Area to debug.
$grid-debug: false; // Deactivate on exit
...
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="note">Note: You can do this and select only the areas you want to debug.</p>

<h2>4.4 The grid gives you information, warnings and tells you about errors</h2>

<p>Check the Sass output window, it will give you a lot of information about what is happening.</p>

<p>You can define different trace levels for the debug mode is true and when is false.</p>

<p>By default, in debug-mode all traces will be showned, information, warnings and errors. And
when the debug-mode is off, you are only informed about errors.</p>

<p>You will have the line where the trace as been issued for a fast correction.</p>

<p>Example of an information trace:<p/>

{% highlight sass %}
@include grid-settings();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When you set the grid settings, some data is set with defaults and other is calculated for you, the settings will be outputed so that you can have a better perception about what is happening under the hoods.</p>

<p>paste the output here</p>

<p>Example of a warning:</p>

{% highlight sass %}
grid-line($padding-top: 1/2, $padding-bottom: 1/4);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In this example the paddings summed don't give a whole line, that would break the vertical rythm of the grid.
The grid will automaticaly correct the values for you maintaining the 1/2 to 1/4 portortion, but you will be warned and informed about the changes made.</p>

<p>paste the output here</p>

<p>Example of an error:</p>

{% highlight sass %}
@include grid-settings($active-columns: 15);
@include grid-unit($width: 1/2);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will generate an error because 15 columns devided by 2 will not give a whole number and that would break the grid.</p>

<p>paste the output here</p>

<p>That's it, you are ready to go.</p>
<p>You have a lot more functionalities in the grid, you can see all about it here. (link to the documentation)</p>
